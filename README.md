# ðŸš— Electric Vehicle Population - SQL Case Study

This project analyzes the **Electric Vehicle Population** dataset using **MySQL Workbench**. The case study includes SQL queries for data retrieval, aggregation, ranking, and performance optimization.

## Features
- Retrieving and filtering data based on conditions
- Aggregating data (count, sum, average, etc.)
- Ranking electric vehicles using **Window Functions & CTEs**
- Performance optimization using **Indexes**
- Data cleaning with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries
